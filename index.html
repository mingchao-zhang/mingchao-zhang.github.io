  <p>I am a third year undergraduate majoring Math and Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am interested in Machine Learning and Computer System. My favorite computer system in Linux because the user interface is very simple.</p>
  <p>I like eating and reading novels. My favorite food is Japanese ramen, and my favorite novel is To Kill a Mocking Bird.</p>
